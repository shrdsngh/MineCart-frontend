## The problem

From
[testing-library/dom-testing-library#107](https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library/issues/107):

> [...] it is becoming apparent the need to express user actions on a web page
> using a higher-level abstraction than [`fireEvent`][fire-event]

## The solution

`user-event` tries to simulate the real events that would happen in the browser
as the user interacts with it. For example `userEvent.click(checkbox)` would
change the state of the checkbox.
